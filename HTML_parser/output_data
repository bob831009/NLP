Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness that is new to humans. It was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has since spread to several other countries, including the United States. Most people infected with MERS-CoV developed severe acute respiratory illness, including fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Many of them have died.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
Fact sheet N°401
June 2015
Key facts
Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause diseases ranging from the common cold to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
Typical MERS symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is common, but not always present.  Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported.
Approximately 36% of reported patients with MERS have died.
Although the majority of human cases of MERS have been attributed to human-to-human infections, camels are likely to be a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of MERS infection in humans. However, the exact role of camels in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown.
The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as occurs when providing unprotected care to a patient.
Symptoms
The clinical spectrum of MERS-CoV infection ranges from no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to severe acute respiratory disease and death. A typical presentation of MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath. Pneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can cause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in an intensive care unit. Approximately 36% of reported patients with MERS-CoV have died. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older people, people with weakened immune systems, and those with chronic diseases such as cancer, chronic lung disease and diabetes.
Source of the virus
MERS-CoV is a zoonotic virus that is transmitted from animals to humans. The origins of the virus are not fully understood but, according to the analysis of different virus genomes, it is believed that it originated in bats and was transmitted to camels sometime in the distant past.
Transmission
Non-human to human transmission: The route of transmission from animals to humans is not fully understood, but camels are likely to be a major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and an animal source of infection in humans. Strains of MERS-CoV that are identical to human strains have been isolated from camels in several countries, including Egypt, Oman, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.
Human-to-human transmission: The virus does not appear to pass easily from person to person unless there is close contact, such as providing unprotected care to an infected patient. There have been clusters of cases in healthcare facilities, where human-to-human transmission appears to be more probable, especially when infection prevention and control practices are inadequate. Thus far, no sustained community transmission has been documented.
The virus appears to be circulating throughout the Arabian Peninsula, primarily in Saudi Arabia, where the majority of cases (>85%) have been reported since 2012. Several cases have been reported outside the Middle East. Most of these infections are believed to have been acquired in the Middle East, and then exported outside the region. The ongoing outbreak in the Republic of Korea is the largest outbreak outside of the Middle East, and while concerning, there is no evidence of sustained human to human transmission in the Republic of  Korea.  For all other exported cases, no secondary or limited secondary transmission has been reported in countries with exported cases.
Prevention and treatment
No vaccine or specific treatment is currently available. Treatment is supportive and based on the patient’s clinical condition.
As a general precaution, anyone visiting farms, markets, barns, or other places where camels and other animals are present should practice general hygiene measures, including regular hand washing before and after touching animals, and should avoid contact with sick animals.
The consumption of raw or undercooked animal products, including milk and meat, carries a high risk of infection from a variety of organisms that might cause disease in humans. Animal products that are processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption, but should also be handled with care to avoid cross contamination with uncooked foods. Camel meat and camel milk are nutritious products that can continue to be consumed after pasteurization, cooking, or other heat treatments.
Until more is understood about MERS-CoV, people with diabetes, renal failure, chronic lung disease, and immunocompromised persons are considered to be at high risk of severe disease from MERS-CoV infection. These people should avoid contact with camels, drinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been properly cooked.
Health-care facilities
Transmission of the virus has occurred in health‐care facilities in several countries, including from patients to health‐care providers and between patients in a health care setting before MERS-CoV was diagnosed. It is not always possible to identify patients with MERS‐CoV early or without testing because symptoms and other clinical features may be non‐specific.
Infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS‐CoV in health‐care facilities. Facilities that provide care for patients suspected or confirmed to be infected with MERS‐CoV should take appropriate measures to decrease the risk of transmission of the virus from an infected patient to other patients, health‐care workers, or visitors. Health‐care workers should be educated and trained in infection prevention and control and should refresh these skills regularly.
Travel
WHO does not recommend the application of any travel or trade restrictions or entry screening related to MERS-CoV.
WHO response
WHO is working with clinicians and scientists in affected countries and internationally to gather and share scientific evidence to better understand the virus and the disease it causes, and to determine outbreak response priorities, treatment strategies, and clinical management approaches. The Organization is also working with countries to develop public health prevention strategies to combat the virus.
Together with affected countries and international technical partners and networks, WHO is coordinating the global health response to MERS, including: the provision of updated information on the situation; conducting risk assessments and joint investigations with national authorities; convening scientific meetings; and developing guidance and training for health authorities and technical health agencies on interim surveillance recommendations, laboratory testing of cases, infection prevention and control, and clinical management.
The Director‐General has convened an Emergency Committee under the International Health Regulations (2005) to advise her as to whether this event constitutes a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) and on the public health measures that should be taken. The Committee has met a number of times since the disease was first identified. WHO encourages all Member States to enhance their surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and to carefully review any unusual patterns of SARI or pneumonia cases.
Countries, whether or not MERS cases have been reported in them, should maintain a high level of vigilance, especially those with large numbers of travellers or migrant workers returning from the Middle East. Surveillance should continue to be enhanced in these countries according to WHO guidelines, along with infection prevention and control procedures in health-care facilities. WHO continues to request that Member States report to WHO all confirmed and probable cases of infection with MERS-CoV together with information about their exposure, testing, and clinical course to inform the most effective international preparedness and response.

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)
, previously known as novel
coronavirus
(nCoV), is a viral respiratory illness, which was first reported in Saudi Arabia, in 2012. The source of MERS is currently unknown, though it is likely to have originated from an animal.
The MERS virus is currently spreading in South Korea. This, in combination with the fact that coronaviruses can often mutate, has caused increased fear that MERS could become a pandemic.
MERS-CoV is dissimilar to other coronaviruses; there is currently no vaccine.
Most confirmed cases of MERS-CoV have displayed symptoms of severe acute respiratory illness. Approximately 36% of patients reported to have MERS have died.

Fast facts on MERS
Here are some key points about MERS-CoV. More detail and supporting information is in the main article.
MERS-CoV was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012.
MERS-CoV belongs to the coronavirus family.
All cases have been linked to countries in and neighboring the Arabian Peninsula.
Cases of MERS-CoV reported in other countries were travel-related and first developed in the Middle East.
Mammals are thought to play a role in the transmission of the virus, with bats and camels likely vectors for the disease.
In addition to humans, strains of MERS-CoV have been identified in camels in Qatar, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, and in a bat in Saudi Arabia.
Doctors describe MERS-CoV as a flu-like illness with signs and symptoms of
pneumonia
.
Sufferers of MERS-CoV will generally develop severe acute respiratory illness. Some people have reported mild respiratory illness with others showing no symptoms.
There are no specific treatments for patients who become ill with MERS-CoV infection.
Out of the confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, around 36% have been fatal.
MERS Outbreak updates
August 10, 2015
Saudi Arabia's health ministry (MOH) has reported 10 new MERS-CoV cases, as well as 1 death in Riyadh occurring August 7-10, 2015. One health care worker is included in these latest cases, with seven patients in stable condition, three in critical condition, and one in home isolation.
August 6, 2015
The National IHR Focal Point for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia informed the World Health Organization of two additional cases of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection on July 29, 2015. The two patients are a 67-year-old male from Riyadh city (currently in critical condition in ICU), and a 44-year-old female from Alkharj city (currently in stable condition).
June 28, 2015
The South Korea Prime Minister has announced a "de facto end" to the MERS-CoV outbreak, which has killed 36 people in the country to date. No new infection has been reported in 23 days, however, WHO have refused to confirm this. According to WHO, a 28-day incubation period is required - the last infection in South Korea was recorded on July 4, 2015.
June 24, 2015
An additional six cases of MERS-CoV were reported in Saudi Arabia in July. Since 2012, WHO have been notified of 1,374 laboratory-confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV to date, including at least 490 related deaths around the world.
June 5, 2015
In light of the recent outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), WHO and the Republic of Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare will conduct a joint mission in the Republic of Korea.
This joint mission is to gain information and review the situation in the Republic of Korea including the epidemiological pattern, the characteristic of the virus and clinical features.
Based on current data and WHO's risk assessment, there is no evidence to suggest sustained human-to-human transmission in communities and no evidence of airborne transmission.
June 2, 2015
The outbreak of MERS-CoV in the Republic of Korea continues to evolve. The Republic of Korea's first, or "index", case was confirmed on May 20, 2015.
To date, contact tracing has identified a total of 25 laboratory-confirmed cases, including the index case and among health care workers caring for him, patients who were being cared for at the same clinics or hospitals, and family members and visitors. Two of these confirmed cases have been fatal.
June 2, 2015
By June 2, 2015, a total of 1,179 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with MERS-CoV have been reported to WHO since 2012, including at least 442 deaths.
What is MERS?
MERS-CoV belongs to the coronavirus family - the same family of viruses that cause the common cold. Human coronaviruses were first classified in the mid-1960s, with the coronavirus subgroups defined as alpha, beta, gamma and delta. There are currently six coronaviruses known to affect humans, including:
MERS-CoV belongs to the coronavirus family. Human coronaviruses were first classified in the mid 1960s. MERS-CoV was first reported in 2012 in Saudi Arabia.
Alpha coronaviruses
Human coronavirus 229E
Human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63, New Haven coronavirus).
Beta coronaviruses
Human coronavirus OC43
Human coronavirus HKU1
SARS-CoV
Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV).
Coronaviruses typically infect one species type or those that are closely related. However, SARS-CoV infects both humans and animals including monkeys, Himalayan palm civets, raccoon dogs, cats, dogs, and rodents. MERS-CoV has so far been seen to infect humans, camels and bats.
The common cold is a virally related syndrome. It is connected to over 100 separate viruses, including human coronavirus.
MERS-CoV is a species in lineage C of the genus beta coronavirus, which presently includes tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5.
MERS-CoV is a species in lineage C of the genus beta coronavirus, which presently includes tylonycteris bat coronavirus HKU4 and pipistrellus bat coronavirus HKU5. Although it features in the same subgroup, MERS-CoV is different from the coronavirus that caused the 2003 outbreak of
severe acute respiratory syndrome
(SARS). However, MERS-CoV and the virus that causes
SARS
are both similar to coronaviruses found in bats.
MERS-CoV appears most closely to resemble the not-yet-classified viruses from insectivorous European and African bats in the Vespertilionidae and Nycteridae families.
Since April, 2012, 26 countries have reported cases of MERS, with all known cases linked to countries in or neighboring the Arabian Peninsula.
Cases of MERS-CoV reported in other countries were travel-related and first developed in the Middle East. Countries that have declared cases to date include:
Bahrain
Iraq
Iran
Israel
Jordan
Kuwait
Lebanon
Oman
Palestine
Qatar
Saudi Arabia
Syria
United Arab Emirates (UAE)
The West Bank
Yemen.

Recent developments on MERS-CoV from MNT news
Assessing the South Korea MERS outbreak: could it happen elsewhere?
There are two main questions that have been raised following the South Korea outbreak: how did the virus manage to affect so many people in a country far away from the geographic region where the virus is most prevalent? And could a similar outbreak occur in other countries with sophisticated health care systems?
What causes MERS?
MERS-CoV is thought to be a zoonotic virus that can lead to secondary infections in humans. It appears that exposure to camels or camel-products is the main source of human infection, although the virus has also been seen in bats. Human-to-human transmission has also been observed, primarily in health care settings rather than in the community.
It is thought mammals play a role in the transmission of the virus - bats and camels remaining a high contender.
In addition to humans, strains of MERS-CoV have been identified in:
Camels in Qatar, Egypt and Saudi Arabia
A bat in Saudi Arabia.
MERS-CoV antibodies were found in camels across Africa and the Middle East, indicating that they had previously been infected with MERS-CoV or a closely related virus.
Researchers from three centers in the United States and two in Saudi Arabia conducted complete genetic sequences for MERS-CoV isolates generated from five camels; the results verified that these were identical to published sequences of isolates from human.
Goats, cows, sheep, water buffalo, swine and wild birds have been tested for antibodies to MERS-CoV; none have yet been detected.
The findings above support the hypothesis that camels are a probable source of infection transfer to humans, while bats may be the ultimate reservoir of the virus. Close contact between a person and an infected camel appears to be necessary for the transmission of MERS-CoV, and it has been suggested that the virus could infect humans through air, and through consumption of camel milk or meat.
Experts have commented that although the respiratory route of transmission is the most likely, research suggests that MERS-CoV can survive in raw camel milk marginally longer than milk of other species. This has prompted calls for further investigation of the potential for foodborne transmission of the virus.
Recent developments on MERS-CoV causes from MNT news
MERS may have started in bats in Saudi Arabia
Researchers have discovered what they believe could be the animal origin of Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) - after examining a bat in Saudi Arabia near where the first person was infected with the mystery virus.
Do camels vent the MERS virus?
Previous research has suggested that camels could be a carrier of the virus, passing it to humans, but a new study has confirmed for the first time that camels actually emit volumes of the virus - making them suspect number one for spreading it to humans.
Symptoms of MERS
The most common symptoms of MERS are
:
Fever
100 degrees F or higher
Cough
Breathing difficulties
Chills
Chest pain
Body aches
Sore throat
Malaise - a general feeling of being unwell
Headache
Diarrhea
Nausea/Vomiting
Runny nose
Renal (kidney) failure
Pneumonia.
Doctors describe MERS as a flu-like illness with signs and symptoms of pneumonia. Early reports described symptoms as similar to those found in cases of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). However, unlike MERS-CoV, SARS infections did not cause renal failure.
Sufferers of MERS will generally develop severe acute respiratory illness, although some people have reported mild respiratory illness and others remain asymptomatic.

we look at who is most at risk, the difference between MERS-CoV And SARS and the options available for prevention and treatment of MERS.

Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)
Important information for health professionals and the general public on MERS.
Page last updated: 25 September 2015
MERS coronavirus is a disease caused by a new virus that can cause a rapid onset of severe respiratory disease in people. Most severe cases have occurred in people with underlying conditions that may make them more likely to get respiratory infections.
All cases have lived in or travelled to the Middle East, or have had close contact with people who acquired the infection in the Middle East. There have been no cases in Australia.
The Department has made the following information resources available for a range of audiences.
Fact Sheet for consumers/patients
Information for GPs on MERS coronavirus
Information for clinical, laboratory and public health personnel on MERS coronavirus
CDNA National Guidelines for Public Health Units – MERS coronavirus

Saudi Arabia Is Reporting a Surge in MERS Deaths

Some 2 million Muslims are due to arrive next month for the annual hajj pilgrimage
+ READ ARTICLE
A
rash
of fatalities from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) has been reported in Saudi Arabia, where 19 people have died after contracting the disease this week alone.
Including the recent spate, the kingdom’s Health Ministry has
recorded
502 fatalities and 1,171 reported cases since June 2012 when the virus first appeared, reports Agence France-Presse.
The surge in infections comes as Saudi Arabia prepares to host about 2 million Muslims who will travel to the country for the annual hajj pilgrimage next month.
Health authorities shut down the emergency ward in one of the capital Riyadh’s largest hospitals last week, after at least 46 people, including hospital staff, contracted the disease.
MERS is viral respiratory infection that causes fever, coughs and breathing difficulties. It is caused by a coronavirus and is considered more deadly but less contagious than its cousin Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which spread globally in 2002 at an eventual cost of more than 8,000 lives.

South Korea declares 'de facto end' to Mers virus
28 July 2015
From the section
Asia

The prime minister apologised for the government's response to the outbreak
South Korea's Prime Minister Hwang Kyo-ahn has declared a "de facto end" to the outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Virus (Mers).
Mr Hwang said that as there had been no new infections for 23 days, the public "can now be free from worry".
He also apologised for the government's much-criticised response to the virus, which has killed 36 people in South Korea, Yonhap news agency reports.
But the WHO said it was not yet declaring Mers officially over.
A spokeswoman in Manila said the World Health Organisation required 28 days without a new infection to make the announcement - twice the incubation period of the virus. The last case was confirmed in South Korea on 4 July.
South Korean Health Ministry official Kwon Duk-cheol said precautions, including screening at airports, would remain in place "until the situation comes to a formal end", AFP news agency reports.
"We still have many arrivals from the Middle East so there is always a possibility that new patients can come in," he added.
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers)
Mers is caused by a coronavirus, a type of virus which includes the common cold and Sars (severe acute respiratory syndrome).
First cases emerged in the Middle East in 2012, and the first death in Saudi Arabia in June that year.
Believed to have originated in camels, though the transmission to humans is not fully understood.
The virus does not pass easily between humans - infections usually occur in people who have had close contact with an infected person.
Patients have a fever, cough and breathing difficulties, but Mers can also cause pneumonia and kidney failure.
Approximately 36% of reported patients with Mers have died - there is no vaccine or specific treatment.

How South Korea is coping with outbreak
'Shake off all concerns'
Speaking in Seoul Mr Hwang said that "after weighing various circumstances, the medical personnel and the government judge that the people can now be free from worry".
"I ask the public to shake off all concerns over Mers and to resume normal daily activities, including economic, cultural, leisure and school activities," the Yonhap news agency quoted him as saying.

Most South Korea infections have happened at health care centres
"I am sorry to the people for causing worries and discomfort."
Mers appeared in South Korea on 26 May, brought by a man who had visited the Middle East, where the disease was first identified in 2012.
South Korea - the only outbreak outside the Middle East - has
confirmed 186 infections
, with 36 deaths.
The government was accused of being slow to react to the crisis, with most of the infections happened at health centres which were not adequately prepared for a contagious disease.
The outbreak - and subsequent quarantine and restrictions on daily life - have had a disastrous effect on the economy, with tourism seeing a 40% drop in foreign visitors.
Last week, the government approved a 11.5tn won ($9.8bn; £6.3bn) package to help the struggling economy.
