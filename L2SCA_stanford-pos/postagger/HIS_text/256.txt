have more time to learn as much as you can go reading or you can joint activities such as club or cram school so they don't want their children to watch too much TV and actually when you watch TV you will learn some phrases or words that aren't very good so it's not very nice for children to watch too much TV so many to our parents would think that question number six if you are going to buy a cell phone for your grandfather what factors would you consider important when choosing one of the first of all it will be user-friendly because grandpa hasn't used it electronic devices for a long

because when you when you're on a job interview the first it's kind of the first impressions that will make you might make make the job interviewers think so actually you have to dress up yourself so

many people from within are talking and select one of them is taking pictures and the person alive is feeding feeding the lamp was food and actually I haven't ever been to a lamp that I have bad rapids on a farm and while not actually the person in our lives action is forbidden in most dues because when you feet as the animals they are there from the nature now wild and if you feet then they

the questions below for one and half minutes and then record your answers for one and half minutes you may use your test paper to make notes and organize your ideas please record your answers for one and half minutes I think reading articles or e-books on the Internet is kind of a communion because you have where you have it if you have Internet access access you can read them everywhere you want but that the disadvantage is that you don't have access to Internet everywhere so if you on a vacation you can't take your laptop everywhere and still have Internet access so that's where paper MacBook and magazines input is important because when you're on vacation you can read them and you can carry them everywhere you walk back it's kind of heavy so some people still want to read articles on Internet and I don't think paper books are gonna disappear in the future because some people like me I I personally prefer to repaper big because I like the feeling of like limping flipping the pages and touching paper books it's it's a different kind of experience so I think of people and fewer people will be paper books but I don't think it would disappear because yes some people like me that like reading paper books end of part three please read the self introduction sentence again my feet number is 01006 MM registration number is 03629 this is the end of the speaking test
