My C number is 01022 in my registration number is 02256 I did enjoy outdoor educational activities because it makes me feel that and I really enjoy all the fun is really exciting I think I want and physical examination at school there are many teachers that came in they test us their different function of our body is pretty cool hey Jane we usually go when you're flying and you get extra liberties of privilege when your flight attendant don't buy it seems that the medicine isn't really reliable and it's so expensive I don't think it's worth it you should go to see a doctor will go to the pharmacy don't waste your money on this I think the reason why parents don't let the children watch TV is because the programs on the TV are sometimes not appropriate for children and it is very hard to control which channel and which will then their children might see self some of the parents just don't let them watch TV or some of them don't even have to be at home I think it's just event protect their children if I'm going to buy a cell phone for my grandfather I will buy the one with lives of the other large things that you can see because my grandpa didn't have a good eyesight so he also he doesn't mean too much functions you'll get confused he needs easy to operate one I think the advantage to learn foreign language online is that you can organize your time when and where you want to take the lesson as for the disadvantage you can't really interact with the teacher and other classmates so you may lack the experience of conversation or other interactions I think personal experience do matters because the customers likes to interact with people with good appearance but still I think that professional matters very much also sell anything when choosing a job you should spend for you to have the advantage that might so they might get the job I think the pictures probably taken enough time the reason I think is because their shapes cows and sheep's and people that are wearing casual clothes said that they are on a trip person on the lab ignition I did have a similar experience I once said a tiger cub the, actually it was really fun the reason why feeding animals is that in most is because those that to us feed them are usually not appropriate for the so is prevented and also it is below the dangers you're feeding like a tiger line I really would like been a holiday at such a place that's a really good getaway and makes me feel that and all the trouble seem to disappear I've been sues places like this with my family last summer we said the animals and we hiked a little bit and also we swam at the nearby river it really was fun and exciting and I really would like to go to places like this again if I had a chance I think the difference between reading articles or e-books on the Internet and reading paper books and magazines is that when you're reading in on the Internet you don't have to have buy a book and the bookstore and that saves a lot of plates because the law but really is very happy and second is the second difference is that the way you buy books you can buy books on Internet any time anyway but if you want to buy paper books you have to find a bookstore to do that also that reading on the Internet gives you a lot of varieties that you can choose from and also I think that paper books are not likely to disappear in the future reason is because that there are still some people that prefers paper books they preferred the touch and the feeling wet while reading paper books and also all documents that preserve precious heritage are all written in paper books sizing then paper books are not likely to disappear in the future is still very great part of our life my C number is 01022 in my registration number is 02256
