Hello my seat number is 01003 in my registration number is 02379 thank you yes I do enjoy outdoor recreational activities because I like to be out in the sun it gives me a feeling that I'm a life when I'm walking around in playing basketball in like thank you yes I've had a physical examination when I was at the doctors they gave me a full body checkup and I'm seemingly healthy thank you PJ for the last time I saw you house it poses working on place it must be pretty hard to get discounts on tickets uncle please don't do something rash medicine found on the streets might be false and you could be endangering yourself by eating unknown medicine the shows we watch now a day are full of violence sex ed and other influences that are bad for kids at an early age so in order to prevent their kids from experiencing this sort parents sometimes forbid kids from watching too much television my grandfather's pretty old so I'm not sure if she should have a cell phone that has the many applications that mine does so I just need to keep it simple with just the basic the basic needs that that he should get and I don't have to worry about too many fancy fancy stuff the advantages that you could stay at home and learn a language from the Internet and it's pretty cheap compared to having to find a teacher and have a one-on-one list blessed the disadvantage is that a computer can't can't replace real human contacts though so it's only one-sided he's always talking to you and you are unable to ask questions yes you need to emit and of confidence and show the employer player that are willing to to to prepare yourself to do this job if you can't even organize yourself and your appearance it's pretty clear that you are unable to to do with the responsibility of having a job yes this picture was probably taken at a farm place one that allows interaction between animals and the human guest I think that it's a farm because on the tent to the left of the green tech it says farm in Chinese so I just translated into English and a lot of animals so it's probably a Farm Pl., #2 to prevent person on the left is feeding this sheep and I have fed pets too but only at places where they say please feed the pad and they give you like grass where you can feed it and is pretty fun because it feels like the animal needs you and that you're doing both the farmer and animal a favor by feeding the pet number three this person's action feeding the sheep is probably forbidden in most sues because the zookeepers can't control what people actually feed the pet you are allowed to do it on their own I've seen people feed like monkeys like chips and the like so it's probably harmful to the animals health I would like to spend a holiday here because I like to interact with nature and feeding sheep is pretty cool and of from number two know I've had an enjoyable experience's reading articles or e-books on the Internet differ from reading paper books and magazines in that you have a much wider variety to choose from but on the other hand it also makes you have less patience with what you're doing without for example if I'm reading a book passage on the article online and I feel that it's not that interesting I just switch on and go down to the next article however if I'm reading a magazine I go through every single article written by every single writer closely because I have nothing else to go to I don't think paper books are likely to disappear in the future because paper feels more substantial you have something in your hands that you can flip and it's an enjoyable experience really and reading paper books or magazines is also less harmful to the eyes and a long term and won't be tempted to read in the dark as you would if you had like a of e-book or an iPad to read from him it's easier to skim through on important parts so say you're reading a passage that is boring you can just sort of say okay the next page is more important so I'll just sort of skim through it I'll browse through it and we don't go on it's also easier to find passages that foreshadowed later pop twists of the plot such as let's say you're reading Harry Potter okay thank you hello my C number is 01003 in my registration number is 02379 thank you for your attention thank you
