half minutes on this picture is probably taken in places like Japan and pleasant are cold because the people there are mostly for like aliens and it's cold out there and the now mostly Asians and the person on the left is feeding the on the sheep and I have never had this kind of experience but is to be honest I don't really like animals and having such a kind of and interact them with them like this and so I don't really like zoos and I'm the person feeding usually they will let you feed and feed them at the Hamilton zoo sees because they're afraid of no some kind of poisons are things that aren't clean or are good for the animals and might make make them sick so it actually forbidden in zoos and I I won't think that I would spend all day in such place because it seems like a cool place and there are animals and there isn't much of view because treat you know the treatment of these are on any leaves on trees and people are all around and with sheiks yet she tolerant place I don't

minutes and then record your answers for one and half minutes you may use your test paper to make notes and organize your ideas please record your answers for one and half while I think that reading articles or e-books on Internet aren't really different from ring paperbacks and back magazines because people people these days have devices like iPhones iPads and no systems like androids and stuff like that out with them all time is like a very convenient thing to do to just put her book which might wait for like yeah out my way a lot if you put a lot of them in our bags and just take them around you can just not put them in your iPads and you have like hundreds of hundreds of books without even taking them around and paper and paper books and magazines are mostly same and I don't think that paper books are likely to disappear in the future because no important important books with no important information are actually not liking not likely to take in the device devices like like those because it's actually easily to get salt to be stolen and easily and to get lost so usually at the amount on opinion I think that if you want something important and for important for the human being or something that you should write them in a book and keep them safe instead of just putting that in devices because devices are easily broke a broken and then their electric and in the park
