apparently there are a lot of animals out in this picture there are a few shapes go in around and a person in a lab is feeding one of the sheet and I do have I have a lot of experience like feeding animals because I major in animal science in college and sometimes we have to feed a lot of animals like pigs and chickens and sheep of cores so the experience was quite a fun at the first time but

may use your test paper to make notes and organize your ideas please record your answers for one and a half minutes reading paper books is more tradition now edits it feels different from reading articles online is reading articles online sometimes and get your eyes to tired and reading paper books makes you feel more decent but I think they they've changed a lot during recent years because now there are new gadgets out like iPad that you can read articles or e-books everywhere you go just because you have an iPad so I think it's getting more and more convenient to read articles on like as you have smart cell phones iPad to read everything did you want to read online everywhere and that's why I think the paper books are likely to disappear but maybe not recently but I think it definitely will disappear in the future because things like iPad at so technical it's very popular right now it's too popular so maybe a paper books would most likely to disappear even in newspapers wouldn't be there to exist anymore I think that's a very sad thing reading and papers is actually a lot of fun in makes you feel like you're actually reading into part three please read the self
